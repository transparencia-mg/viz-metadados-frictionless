- Publicação / Shipping

- Todas as etapas desse fluxo possuem custos, mas apenas uma traz benefícios/valor, o uso

- Enquanto intermediário a gente quer maximizar a utilidade de todos os participantes

- Como que a gente diminui [os custos](https://www.stokki.com.br/principais-custos-logisticos/) (reduz a fricção) nessa cadeia de valor (cadeia produtiva)? Padronização. A gente precisa de uma interface[^1]

[^1]: In computing, an interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate/independent components of a computer system exchange information (or communicate). 

> Charmaine Chua, assistant professor of global studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has spent most of her career studying the growth and politics of the global logistics system. She explains that the move toward containerization did not take place overnight. Ports had to implement massive infrastructure upgrades, in turn radically reconfiguring the urban ecosystem. “It was a process not just about the box but about organizing the whole world transportation system in order to standardize the process in which containers would travel,” she said. “It requires ecological changes to port cities and massive expansions of trucking and shipping spaces that have huge consequences both for the lived environment for people who live in these cities as well as the ecological damage it has done to ports.” But the cost savings were hard to ignore.
